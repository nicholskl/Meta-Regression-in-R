    "text": "Meta-analysis is a statistical approach used to synthesize results from multiple studies to derive conclusions with greater statistical power and generalizability. By combining data from several independent studies, meta-analysis helps to resolve uncertainty when individual studies disagree and provides a more precise estimate of the effect size.\n\n\nMeta-analysis involves systematically reviewing, extracting, and statistically combining data from a collection of studies that address a common research question. This technique enables researchers to:\n\nSummarize Evidence: Meta-analysis aggregates findings, offering a comprehensive overview of what the research community knows about a particular topic.\nIncrease Power: By pooling data from multiple studies, meta-analysis enhances the statistical power to detect effects that individual studies might miss.\nAddress Variability: It helps to understand the variation in study results, identifying factors that contribute to differences across studies.\n\n\n\n\nMeta-analysis goes beyond simple summary by:\n\nEstimating Overall Effect: It calculates a weighted average effect size, giving more weight to studies with larger samples or more precise estimates.\nExploring Heterogeneity: It assesses the degree of variability among study results to understand if differences are due to chance or other underlying factors.\nIdentifying Subgroup Effects: By stratifying data, meta-analysis can explore how effects vary across different subgroups, such as age, gender, or intervention type.\n\n\n\n\nWhile meta-analysis is a valuable tool, it has a few challenges that can make a traditional and straightforward approach difficult. Two of the most significant problems are heterogeneity in methods and dependence among study outcomes.\n\nHeterogeneity in Methods: Studies included in a meta-analysis often differ in their design, populations, interventions, and outcome measures. This heterogeneity can lead to inconsistent findings and complicate the interpretation of the combined results. Identifying and accounting for these differences is crucial for a robust meta-analysis. This is particularly salient in psychology studies where papers even on a well traditioned and niche idea can vary wildly in methodology (see this famous and controversial meta-analysis on nudges for an example.\nDependence Among Study Outcomes: When studies use similar methodologies or populations, their outcomes may not be entirely independent. This dependence can bias the results and undermine the validity of the meta-analysis. Properly addressing dependence is essential to avoid overestimating the precision of the combined effect size. This can be true when several effect sizes might be produced from a single paper, when several effect sizes might need to be clustered by the measure that they use, or by the types of participants included, for example\n\n\n\n\nAddressing the issues of heterogeneity and dependence is critical for a meaningful meta-analysis. One advanced technique to tackle these problems is meta-regression. Meta-regression extends traditional meta-analysis by incorporating study-level covariates, moderators, and allows for mixed-level modeling, allowing researchers to:\n\nModel Heterogeneity: By including variables that might explain differences between studies, meta-regression helps to account for and understand sources of heterogeneity.\nAdjust for Dependence: It provides a framework to adjust for potential correlations among study outcomes, ensuring more accurate and reliable results.\n\nIn the next section, I will describe meta-regression in greater detail, exploring how it works and how it can be applied to enhance the insights gained from meta-analysis."

    "text": "What is Meta-Regression?\nMeta-regression is a statistical tool used in meta-analysis, where multiple studies are combined to understand a phenomenon more comprehensively. This technique is particularly valuable when studies vary significantly in terms of settings, methodologies, or populations. Meta-regression explores the relationship between study characteristics (like sample size or study quality) and study outcomes, helping to explain the heterogeneity (variability) among the results of these studies. Here, we’ll dive into the basics of meta-regression using the dmetar and metafor packages and the MVRegressionData dataset in R.\n\nMeta-regression is an extension of the standard meta-analysis, allowing researchers to investigate how study-level covariates impact the effect size (the quantitative measure of the magnitude of the experimental effect). For instance, in clinical research, larger studies might show different effect sizes compared to smaller studies due to systematic differences in patient selection or treatment implementation. In psychology studies, where methodological variance between studies can be substantial, it can be difficult to collapse across several studies as the differences in design may affect the effect sizes and drive unexplained variance."

    "text": "How Does Meta-Regression Solve This Problem?\nThe primary goal of meta-regression is to determine whether covariates significantly contribute to the observed heterogeneity among the results. This not only helps in understanding the factors influencing the outcomes but also in improving the design of future studies and tailoring interventions more effectively.\nMeta-regression analyzes the relationship between effect sizes and study-level characteristics by fitting a regression model. This allows researchers to adjust for different variables and isolate the effects of specific characteristics on the study outcome. By doing so, meta-regression provides a more nuanced understanding of the factors that contribute to the differences in study results. Moreover, a traditional meta-analysis does not account for dependency across effect sizes as nimbly as meta-regression does, with meta-regression offering multiple avenues for correcting dependency (mixed-effects models, clustering standard errors, cluster wild bootstrapping)."

This could be any characteristic of the study, such as sample size, study design, or population characteristics, that might influence the effect size.\n\\(\\epsilon_k\\) is the within-study error term, capturing the sampling variability or random error in the effect size estimate for the \\(k\\)-th study. This term accounts for the fact that even studies with the same covariate value may have different observed effect sizes due to random sampling variation. \\(\\zeta_k\\) is the between-study error term, representing the residual heterogeneity not explained by the covariates.

The rma function is the workhorse of the metafor package for meta-regression and has a few flexible variants, including rma.mv for mixed-effect/multivariate linear modeling. The normal random-effects regression model can be fit with rma(yi, vi, data = dat).\nMany R users will be familiar with the formula syntax used in functions like lm() and glm(). Similarly, one can specify the desired meta-analytic model using the mods argument, which accepts a formula in the form ~ model (e.g., mods = ~ mod1 + mod2 + mod3). This approach allows for the easy addition of interactions, polynomial terms, and factors to the model. A fixed-effects model can be fitted with rma(yi, vi, data = dat, method = \"FE\").\n\n# Running the meta-regression model\nmodel_1 &lt;- rma(yi, vi, data = data_es)\nsummary(model_1)\n\n\nRandom-Effects Model (k = 13; tau^2 estimator: REML)\n\n  logLik  deviance       AIC       BIC      AICc   \n-12.2024   24.4047   28.4047   29.3746   29.7381   \n\ntau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0.3132 (SE = 0.1664)\ntau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):      0.5597\nI^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability):   92.22%\nH^2 (total variability / sampling variability):  12.86\n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nQ(df = 12) = 152.2330, p-val &lt; .0001\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se     zval    pval    ci.lb    ci.ub      \n -0.7145  0.1798  -3.9744  &lt;.0001  -1.0669  -0.3622  *** \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe estimated between-study variance (𝜏2τ2) was 0.3132 (SE = 0.1664), with the square root of this variance (𝜏τ) being 0.5597. This high 𝜏τ value indicates considerable variability in effect sizes across studies. The \\(I^2\\) statistic, which represents the percentage of total variation due to heterogeneity rather than chance, was 92.22% which is a fairly high value. Here’s a general rule of thumb for interpreting these values where anything over .75 (75%) could be considered as considerable heterogeneity between studies. This substantial heterogeneity suggests that differences between studies contribute significantly to the variability in effect sizes. Furthermore, the \\(H^2\\) statistic, which compares total variability to sampling variability, was 12.86, indicating that the observed variability greatly exceeds what would be expected by sampling error alone.\nThe test for heterogeneity was significant (𝑄(12)=152.23Q(12)=152.23, 𝑝&lt;.0001), confirming the presence of substantial heterogeneity among the studies. This suggests that the effect sizes are not consistent across studies and that additional factors may influence the variability.\nThe model results showed an overall effect size estimate (log relative risk) of -0.7145 (SE = 0.1798). Transforming these values with the exp() function, we get a value of .49 with a 95% CI of (0.34, 0.70). The negative estimate indicates that the vaccinated group had a lower risk of tuberculosis infection compared to the control group. Moreover, for the vaccinated subjects there was nearly half the risk of getting tuberculosis. This test was highly significant (𝑧=−3.97z=−3.97, 𝑝&lt;.0001p&lt;.0001), with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -1.0669 to -0.3622. The confidence interval not including zero further supports the conclusion that the vaccination significantly reduces the risk of tuberculosis.\nThese model fit results can be obtained with confint(). A key vizualization of effect sizes in a meta-analysis paper is the forest plot, and this can also be handled via metafor with the forest() function.\n\nkable(confint(model_1))\n\n\n\n\n\nestimate\nci.lb\nci.ub\n\n\n\n\ntau^2\n0.3132433\n0.1196953\n1.111486\n\n\ntau\n0.5596815\n0.3459701\n1.054271\n\n\nI^2(%)\n92.2213861\n81.9177227\n97.678090\n\n\nH^2\n12.8557608\n5.5302769\n43.067984\n\n\n\n\nforest(model_1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this forest plot, mostly what we are looking for is at the bottom most diamond which represents the overall model for the meta-regression, as well as how many of the CIs include 0.

For example, a crucial aspect of meta-analysis (and meta-regression) is outlier analysis. This is typically done in advance of analysis via a Cook’s test, but can also be done via the find.outliers() package.\n\nfind.outliers(model_1)\n\nIdentified outliers (REML) \n------------------------- \n\"4\", \"8\" \n \nResults with outliers removed \n----------------------------- \n\nRandom-Effects Model (k = 11; tau^2 estimator: REML)\n\ntau^2 (estimated amount of total heterogeneity): 0.2281 (SE = 0.1501)\ntau (square root of estimated tau^2 value):      0.4776\nI^2 (total heterogeneity / total variability):   83.01%\nH^2 (total variability / sampling variability):  5.89\n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nQ(df = 10) = 39.6122, p-val &lt; .0001\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se     zval    pval    ci.lb    ci.ub      \n -0.7082  0.1784  -3.9701  &lt;.0001  -1.0578  -0.3586  *** \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nHere, the results show us what the outliers were, as well as the results with those outliers removed. here we can see that the \\(I^2\\) was substantially lowered by removing those outliers.

The omnibus test shows that we can reject the null hypothesis 𝐻0:𝛽1=𝛽2=0H0​:β1​=β2​=0 (QM = 12.20, df = 2, p &lt; 0.01), implying that the moderators collectively have a significant effect. However, only absolute latitude significantly influences vaccine effectiveness (for 𝐻0:𝛽1=0H0​:β1​=0, z = -2.74, p &lt; 0.01), while the other moderator does not (for 𝐻0:𝛽2=0H0​:β2​=0, z = 0.13, p = 0.90). The significant test for residual heterogeneity (QE = 28.33, df = 10, p &lt; 0.01) suggests that there may be other unconsidered moderators affecting vaccine effectiveness.\nWe can then compare these two models in a number of ways, starting first with an anova test, comparing the models similarly to how one would compare two nested regression models.\n\nanova(mef_1, model_1)\n\nWarning: REML comparisons not meaningful for models with different fixed effects\n(use 'refit=TRUE' to refit both models based on ML estimation).\n\n\n\n        df     AIC     BIC    AICc   logLik    LRT   pval       QE  tau^2 \nFull     4 24.2137 25.4241 32.2137  -8.1069                28.3251 0.1108 \nReduced  2 28.4047 29.3746 29.7381 -12.2024 8.1910 0.0166 152.2330 0.3132 \n             R^2 \nFull             \nReduced 64.6322% \n\n\nHere, we see the the full model was a better fit (as indicated by a lower AIC) than the reduced model. We can also visualize the model comparison via funnel plots. The funnel() function generates funnel plots, which are useful for detecting heterogeneity and certain types of publication bias (Rothstein et al. 2005). For models without moderators, the plot displays the observed outcomes on the horizontal axis and their corresponding standard errors (i.e., the square root of the sampling variances) on the vertical axis. A vertical line represents the model estimate, with a pseudo confidence interval region around this estimate, bounded by ±1.96 * SE, where SE is the standard error from the vertical axis. For models with moderators, the plot shows residuals on the horizontal axis against their corresponding standard errors, with a vertical line at zero and a pseudo confidence interval region of ±1.96 * SE.\n\nfunnel(model_1, main = \"Random-Effects Model\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunnel(mef_1, main = \"Mixed-Effects Model\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultilevel Meta-Analysis\nMeta-analysis has multiple levels due to the way data is structured. In the random-effects model, two sources of variability are accounted for: the sampling error \\(\\epsilon_k\\)of individual studies and the between-study heterogeneity \\(\\zeta_k\\). The goal is to estimate the mean μ of the distribution of true effect sizes.\nThese two error terms correspond to two levels in meta-analysis data: the participant level (level 1) and the study level (level 2). At the participant level, data often reaches us in pooled form (e.g., means and standard deviations). Pooling at the study level is performed as part of the meta-analysis. Participants are nested within studies, creating a multilevel structure implicitly described by the random-effects model.\n\n\nExtending to a Three-Level Model\n\\(\\hat{\\theta}{ij} = \\mu + \\zeta^{(2)}{ij} + \\zeta^{(3)}{j} + \\epsilon{ij}\\)\nStatistical independence is crucial when pooling effect sizes in meta-analysis. Dependency between effect sizes can reduce heterogeneity and lead to false-positive results. Dependencies can arise from study authors (e.g., multiple sites or interventions within a study) or the meta-analyst (e.g., studies from different cultural regions).\nTo account for such dependencies, we can introduce a third level in the meta-analysis model. This level can capture nested structures within studies or among clusters of studies. A three-level model explicitly incorporates these dependencies, improving the accuracy of our meta-analytic estimates.\nA three-level model involves three pooling steps: aggregating participant data within studies, nesting effect sizes within clusters, and pooling cluster effects to estimate the overall true effect size (μ). This model explicitly accounts for within-cluster and between-cluster heterogeneity, represented by two heterogeneity terms: \\(\\zeta^{(2)}_{ij}\\) (within-cluster) and \\(\\zeta^{(3)}_{j}\\)​ (between-cluster).\n\n\nMultilevel Models in R\nThese models are particularly well suited to being carried out in the metafor package as well, though using a different function - the rma.mv() function. Below we will make use of the Chernobyl dataset from dmetar. Below we specify a model that is largely similar to our models from earlier but with different clustering.\nVia the random argument, we specify a formula which defines the (nested) random effects. For a three-level model, the formula always starts with ~ 1, followed by a vertical bar |. Behind the vertical bar, we assign a random effect to a grouping variable (such as studies, measures, regions, etc.). This random intercept is the same conceptually to those implemented in mixed-effects models researchers may be more accustomed to.\nThere is a specific syntax in which we can instruct rma.mv to assume nested random effects. This is achieved by using a slash (/) to separate the higher- and lower-level grouping variables. On the left side of the slash, we place the level 3 (cluster) variable, and on the right side, we insert the lower-level variable nested within the larger cluster. The general structure of the formula is: ~ 1 | cluster/effects_within_cluster.\nFor our example, we assume that individual effect sizes (level 2, defined by es.id) are nested within studies (level 3, defined by author). This results in the following formula: ~ 1 | author/es.id.\n\nlibrary(esc)\ndata(\"Chernobyl\")\n\nfull.model &lt;- rma.mv(yi = z, \n                     V = var.z, \n                     slab = author,\n                     data = Chernobyl,\n                     random = ~ 1 | author/es.id, \n                     test = \"t\", \n                     method = \"REML\")\n\nsummary(full.model)\n\n\nMultivariate Meta-Analysis Model (k = 33; method: REML)\n\n  logLik  Deviance       AIC       BIC      AICc   \n-21.1229   42.2458   48.2458   52.6430   49.1029   \n\nVariance Components:\n\n            estim    sqrt  nlvls  fixed        factor \nsigma^2.1  0.1788  0.4229     14     no        author \nsigma^2.2  0.1194  0.3455     33     no  author/es.id \n\nTest for Heterogeneity:\nQ(df = 32) = 4195.8268, p-val &lt; .0001\n\nModel Results:\n\nestimate      se    tval  df    pval   ci.lb   ci.ub      \n  0.5231  0.1341  3.9008  32  0.0005  0.2500  0.7963  *** \n\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nconvert_z2r(0.52)\n\n[1] 0.4777\n\n\nConverting this estimate to \\(r\\), we can see that there is a fairly large correlation of .48, indiciating a substantial relationship between exposure to radiation and mutation rates at Chernobyl."
